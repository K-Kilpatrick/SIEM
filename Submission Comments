Congratulations on an outstanding homework assignment! You’ve demonstrated searching, reporting and alerting mechanisms to monitor a secured network! On the same note, Kelly, excellent job with your reports. 



In the same regard, you’ve identified the approximate date, time, and duration of the attack and its effects!



Your screenshot of the vulnerability report is amazing, Kelly! You’ve depicted the count of critical vulnerabilities Nessus found on the customer database server! You’ve proved the creation of your daily alert to detect any critical vulnerabilities on the server. Well done!



Now, Kelly, you’ve done awesome work with your additional recommendations! You’ve indicated when the brute force attack occurred; you’ve established a baseline of normal activity, and a threshold that could indicate a brute force attack; finally, you’ve confirmed the creation of an hourly alert that checks the threshold and emails the SOC team if triggered!  Well done!



This has been an amazing assignment to bring home all your Cyber skills together, Kelly; keep up the good work and this smooth flow you’ve been able to establish!
