# SIEM
Module 19: Intro to SIEM, Splunk Searches, Splunk Reports and Alerts

Module Description
In this module, we will focus on one of the most popular types of software that security professionals use to monitor their environments: SIEM, which stands for "security information and event management." While there are many different SIEM vendors in today's marketplace, we will primarily focus on one vendor: Splunk.  This week we will learn about Splunk's core functionalities, and next week we will preview Splunk's SIEM product, Splunk Enterprise Security.
This first of two modules dedicated to SIEM will include the following:

Day 1 will cover why and how businesses monitor their environment, how they use alerts to detect security events, and what makes SIEM such a powerful product for managing the many challenges of security monitoring.

Day 2 will introduce a big data analyzation tool called Splunk. We will learn how to use Splunk's Search and Reporting application to create basic and complex Splunk searches.

Day 3 will build on the concepts covered on Day 2, exploring Splunk's reporting and alerting capabilities. We will also learn the importance of "good" alerts and how to build them.

Make informed decisions about which SIEM vendor is best for an organization.

Day 2: Splunk Searches

Explore and select Splunk add-ons and apps based on project needs.

Upload logs into a Splunk repository.

Write complex SPL queries to analyze specific security situations.

Day 3: Splunk Reports and Alerts

Use SPL commands stat and eval to create new fields in Splunk.

Schedule statistical reports in Splunk.

Determine baselines of normal activity in order to trigger alerts.

Design and schedule alerts to notify if an attack is occurring.

In this week's Challenge, students will develop Splunk searches, custom reports, and alerts to monitor a fictional company's security environment in order to protect them from future attacks.

Looking Forward
Next week, we learn advanced Splunk skills, such as how to design visualizations and build dashboards. We will also preview Splunk's  SIEM product Splunk Enterprise Security and introduce Splunk careers and certifications. We will conclude the week with a fun and challenging Splunk mini-project called Master of the SOC.
